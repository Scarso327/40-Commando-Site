        <h2 class="title">ARMA 3 <span class="accent-text">MILSIM</span> GROUP</h2>
        <p>At the core, we are simply a group of friends all looking to enjoy playing a game and have the best possible experience. We are not here for drama or conflict (At least not outside of our operations). Aiming to provide a relaxed environment, almost every major decision is put to a group-wide vote and no one will ever be punished for voicing their opinions or opposing a particular point of view.</p>
        <p>We run weekly operations at 7pm GMT on a Friday night and expect the majority of our members to attend. Obviously, we understand this isn't always possible and will always attempt to make the most out of whatever numbers we have. Our operations are specifically designed and developed by members of our group and attempt to offer a fair mix of both ArmA 3 entertainment and a realistic environment. With that being said, yes, there will be running, formations, communications, etc - but there will also be a great deal of action and simply fun. Any member of our group is always free to make suggestions, voice their concerns and do whatever they can to improve our unit for everyone.</p>
        <p>In the real world, the 40 Commando is a light infantry unit within the Royal Navy. They specialise in rapid worldwide deployment and are highly skilled, adaptable, and capable of combating a wide range of threats in almost any terrain. They have served in every major British conflict, playing a pivotal role in several notable campaigns and operations. The famous Green Beret is worn with pride wherever they're deployed.</p>
        <p>With that being said, very few, if any, of our members are currently serving in any armed forces. Not everything we do will be 100% accurate or realistic. We will always attempt to make things as immersive as possible, but also remembering that this is a game and people don't want to be spending 5-years getting to the second rank.</p>

                    <p>We run weekly operations at <span class="accent-text" style="font-weight: 600">7PM GMT ON FRIDAY</span> that we expect all members to attend if possible. We have a custom system for reporting attendance with a miniumum of 60% to remain apart of our group. Our operations are designed and developed by members of our group and attempt to offer a mix of both relaxed entertainment and serious military simulation.</p>

                    <p>Although we aim to provide a realistic experience we understand it's a game and everyone is here to have fun. Therefore we don't expect a perfect attitude and endorse light "banter" within our sections. Of course there is always "too far" and punishments will be issued for those that push boundaries repeatedly.</p>
